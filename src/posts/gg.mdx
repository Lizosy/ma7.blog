# Welcome to My Blog

This is a **test post** to demonstrate the blog functionality. Let me show you some of the features available.

## Code Highlighting

Here's some JavaScript code:

```javascript
function greetUser(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`);
    return `Nice to meet you, ${name}`;
}

greetUser("Ma7be0");
```

## Python Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Generate first 10 fibonacci numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
```
